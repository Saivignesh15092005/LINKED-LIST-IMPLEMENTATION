##  "LINKED-LIST-IMPLEMENTATION," involves creating a foundational dynamic data structure in C. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations and have a fixed size, a linked list is a collection of individually allocated "nodes" that are connected using pointers. Each node typically comprises two parts: a data field (to store the actual value) and a pointer (or "link") that holds the memory address of the next node in the sequence. This dynamic nature allows the list to grow or shrink as needed during program execution, making it highly flexible for scenarios where the amount of data is unpredictable. You will implement core operations such as creating new nodes, inserting nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific position, deleting nodes, traversing the list to display its contents, and searching for specific elements.The primary sources used are GEMINI AI, Youtube, Chrome browser, VS code studio.
